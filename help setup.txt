To install, unzip the archive, create a database in mysql5.7 or higher and import the database from ADDONS / MySQL /

Next, in the .env files, you need to register access to the database and site URL, as well as access to the database in config / database.php

Installing js node using the sample installation under Ubuntu 18.04

https://www.rosehosting.com/blog/how-to-install-node-js-on-ubuntu-18-04/
apt-get install curl
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_12.x | sudo -E bash -
apt-get install nodejs

Next, you need to run server.js, which is located in the PTWebSocket folder
We do the following

pm2 ls
npm install -g ws
npm install -g request
npm install pm2 -g
pm2 start server.js --watch
check if it works
status pm2

then you need to open port 8449 and in public / socket_config.json register your domain in domain.com format without www and http
